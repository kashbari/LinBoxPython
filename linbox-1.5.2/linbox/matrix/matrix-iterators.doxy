 * @brief NO DOC YET
 *
 * Matrices in general may omit one of the iterators, either the row iterator or
 *  the column iterator. This is useful for, e.g. sparse matrices that are
 *  represented by sparse row vectors, since column vectors are computationally
 *  expensive to compute without directly building the transpose of the matrix.
