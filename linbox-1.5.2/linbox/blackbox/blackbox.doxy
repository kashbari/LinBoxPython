/** \ingroup linbox
  \defgroup blackbox blackbox
  \brief These matrix classes meet the simple interface needed for blackbox algorithms.

  Blackbox matrix algorithms require of the matrix only it's
  property of being a linear operator.  Such algorithms exploit only the
  capacity to multiply the matrix with a vector or suitably shaped matrix (on right or left).
  The advantage is efficient generic methods particularly applicable to sparse and
  structured matrix classes in which matrix-vector product is fast.  Importantly,
  these methods are also space efficient, typically, for an n by n matrix using only O(n) space
  beyond the matrix representation itself.

  These classes all implement the simple black box
  interface as it is defined in the
  LinBox::BlackboxArchetype  base class.  Thus blackbox matrix algorithms may be used on
  objects of any of these classes.  In contrast, classes representing matrices in such
  a way that elimination and other operations can be performed on them
  adhere to more extensive interfaces defined in the \ref matrix directory.

  Some of the classes are intended for general use, some are designed to support specific
  needs of algorithms, and some are primarily for testing purposes.

  Users are most likely to be interested in the sparse matrix classes (SparseMatrix, TriplesBB), the class DenseMatrix,
  and structured matrix classes such as Toeplitz.  Consult the constructors and/or read() member
  function documentation to see how to create them.  To use a blackbox of class BB in a code:

  Classes designed to be used as preconditioners in algorithms or for testing typically also provide
  functionality to generate random instances of the class.
  Examples are Diagonal and Butterfly for preconditioners, xxx for testing.

  Some of the classes provide a rudimentary basis of blackbox operators for a "blackbox calculus."
  These include <code>Compose, Sum, Dif, Submatrix, DirectSum, Inverse, MoorePenrose</code>.

\note Developers: All black box matrices should be derived from the
\link LinBox::BlackboxArchetype BlackboxArchetype \endlink, so that they may be used as parameters to
functions compiled with the blackbox archetype.

Blackboxes exist in 3 states: bare, shaped, and ready.
A bare blackbox results from default construction.  Only shaping functions may be used on bare blackboxes.
Shaping functions establish the field of the elements and the row and column dimensions.
Functions field(), rowdim(), coldim(), and initializing functions may be used on shaped matrices.
initializing functions include read() and, in some cases, setEntry().
The ready() function converts to the ready state.  For many blackbox classes it is optional, for others it is essential.  Mathematical operations are valid on ready blackboxes (apply(), applyTranspose(), matrixHom()).

The mother model is used for the member field of a blackbox.  The lifetime of the field must enclose the lifetime of a blackbox based on the field.  
The public field() function of a blackbox returns a "const Field &" and thus may only be called on a shaped blackbox.
The protected field member is a "const Field *".  
This convention (1) allows bare blackboxes and (2) avoids proliferation of field copies.  While most fields are tiny objects, a few have a large amount of data.
